# Projects
## Machine learning:
1. Car Price Prediction: Random Forest vs Gradient Boosting
 
   - Objective: To compare Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models for predicting car selling prices.

   ## Highlights

   - Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

   - Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² metrics.

   - **Results**: Gradient Boosting performed better with fine-tuned parameters.
