# Projects
## Machine learning:
1. Car Price Prediction: Random Forest vs Gradient Boosting
 
   - Objective: To compare Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models for predicting car selling prices.

   ## Highlights

   - Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

   - Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² metrics.

   - **Results**: Gradient Boosting performed better with fine-tuned parameters.
     
 2. **Loan Approval Prediction:**

    - **Overview**: Loans are one of the significant sources of income for banks and play a critical role in the economy and in individuals to manage expenses, purchase luxuries, etc. However, banks must examine many factors to assess whether the candidate is granted a loan. Since there are many features, banks can automate this process using machine learning tools to reduce the time taken for decision-making.
      
    - **Objective**: To develop a robust machine learning tool that will determine whether a loan application should be accepted or not based on features of the applicant, such as marital status, education level, income, etc.
